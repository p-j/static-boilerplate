==================

A static website boilerplate featuring Bootstrap SASS, Gulp streaming build tool and other niceties

Usage
==================
Prerequisite :
- git (no kidding !)
- ruby & sass gem (may move to libsass and node-sass once tested)
- node w/ npm
- bower
- gulp

And then :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/p-j/static-boilerplate.git

That was easy !
